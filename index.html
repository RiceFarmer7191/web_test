            <h2>Formation of Black Holes</h2>
            <p>
                Black holes are formed when very massive stars reach the end of their life cycles and collapse under their own gravity. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Life of a Massive Star
A star shines for millions of years by burning hydrogen into helium in its core (nuclear fusion). This process creates outward pressure that balances the inward pull of gravity.

2. Supernova Explosion
When the star runs out of fuel, fusion stops. Gravity wins, and the core collapses. For very massive stars (typically over 20–25 times the mass of our Sun), this collapse is so intense that it triggers a massive explosion called a supernova.

3. Collapse Into a Black Hole
If the remaining core is heavy enough (at least 2–3 times the mass of the Sun), no known force can stop the collapse. The matter compresses into an incredibly small point—a singularity—and a black hole is born.

        <h1>Types of Black Holes</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>There are many</h2>
            <p>
               Black holes are classified into four main types based on their mass and origin. Stellar black holes, formed from the collapse of massive stars after supernovae, are the most common and typically range from 3 to 100 times the mass of the Sun. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies and can be millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun; their exact formation process is still unclear but likely involves mergers and steady growth over time. Intermediate black holes, with masses between 100 and 100,000 solar masses, are rarer and may form through collisions in dense star clusters. Lastly, primordial black holes are still theoretical and may have formed shortly after the Big Bang due to early-universe density fluctuations; they are being studied as possible dark matter candidates.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>About Black Holes</h2>
            <p>
                Black holes are among the most mysterious and powerful objects in the universe. Born from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity, black holes represent the ultimate extremes of nature: infinite density, zero volume, and gravity so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape.

At the heart of a black hole lies the singularity, a point of infinite curvature where space and time break down. Surrounding this is the event horizon, the invisible boundary beyond which escape becomes impossible. Anything that crosses it—stars, gas, even light—gets pulled in forever.

Black holes come in different sizes:

Stellar black holes, formed from dying stars

Supermassive black holes, millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun, lurking in the centers of galaxies

Intermediate and primordial black holes, still largely theoretical and under investigation

Though black holes are invisible, they reveal themselves through their interactions with nearby matter. As material spirals in, it heats up and emits intense radiation, often making black holes some of the brightest objects in the sky when seen through X-ray telescopes.

Black holes challenge our understanding of physics, linking Einstein’s theory of relativity with the puzzling world of quantum mechanics. They stretch the fabric of space-time, slow down time, and may even hold clues to the origins of the universe—or gateways to others.

Dark, enigmatic, and endlessly fascinating, black holes are nature’s most powerful reminders that the universe still holds deep secrets waiting to be uncovered.

        <h1>Effects on Space-Time</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Black holes have profound effects on space-time due to their intense gravity. They warp the fabric of space-time, causing gravitational time dilation, where time slows down near a black hole compared to farther away. Their strong gravity also bends light, creating gravitational lensing that can distort or magnify distant objects. Anything falling toward a black hole experiences spaghettification, a stretching effect caused by extreme tidal forces. These effects make black holes natural laboratories for testing Einstein’s theory of general relativity and exploring the mysteries of the universe.</h2>
